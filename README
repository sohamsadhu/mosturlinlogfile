This is a small program written in python 3.2 to sort out the URLs in a given log file.

The program takes in the number of URLs to be displayed and the name of the log file from where to source the data.

It then fetches the number of URLS to be displayed that were the most referenced, and shows them in a tabular format.
Small changes like redirecting the output to a text file by use of '>' operator on the shell can easily make this a good utility program.

Usage: python3.2 HighURLFinder.py 3 log

Sample Run:
$ python3.2 HighURLFinder.py 3 log
